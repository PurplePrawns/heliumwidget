Helium (HNT) widget for Scriptable

Requires: https://scriptable.app
For iOS only.

To configure, install in Scriptable and then EDIT the script with YOURWALLETADDRESS.
You can get this address in the Helium app.

To use the Helium logo as header, simply comment/uncomment the lines near the bottom of the script.
It should be pretty self explanatory. 

If you found this useful, consider dropping a spare coin or HNT dust for a coffee:
